# Mandelbrot-3D-Fractal

This program represents a 3-dimensional version of the Mandelbrot fractal I originally created in JavaScript. We can execute or visualize this Python code in a 3D software like Blender, thanks to the <i>text-editor</i> property. A real-time visualization of such fractal written Java is also provided.
